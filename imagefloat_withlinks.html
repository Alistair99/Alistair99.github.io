        <p><strong>El Capitan</strong> (above) is a 3,000-foot (910 m) vertical rock formation
            in Yosemite National Park, located on the north side of Yosemite
            Valley, near its western end. The granite monolith is one of the
            world's favorite challenges for rock climbers. The formation was
            named "El Capitan" by the Mariposa Battalion when it explored the
            valley in 1851.</p>

        <p><strong>Tunnel View</strong> (above) is a viewpoint on State Route 41 located directly east
            of the Wawona Tunnel as one enters Yosemite Valley from the south.
            The view looks east into Yosemite Valley including the southwest face
            of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Falls. This is, to many, the
            first views of the popular attractions in Yosemite.</p>
