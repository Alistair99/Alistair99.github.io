        I am a Reader in Operational Research (OR) and the Director of Research in the Faculty of Environment and Technology at the University of the West of England.   I was formerly a Production Systems Specialist at UniSoma (an OR consulting and systems development company in Brazil), an academic adviser at IBM's Latin American Institute of Technology, an analyst in the UK Government OR Service, a lecturer at several UK universities, and a VSO volunteer Maths teacher at Wa Secondary School in the Upper West region of Ghana, West Africa.
