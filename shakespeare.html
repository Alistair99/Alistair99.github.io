    <h1>To Be or Not To Be</h1>
    <nav>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56965/speech-to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-question</nav>

    <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
      Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
      And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br>
      No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
      The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
      That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br>
      Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep.</p>

    <h2>To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:</h2>

    <p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
      When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,.</p>

        <h3>Must give us pause</h3>

        <p>—there's the respect<br>
          That makes calamity of so long life.<br>
          For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
          Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
          The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,</p>

        <h3>The insolence of office</h3>

        <p>and the spurns
          That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,<br>
          When he himself might his quietus make<br>
          With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br>
          To grunt and sweat under a weary lifes.</p>
